## Dictionary Guidelines

Before you add new entries to our dictionary, please read the following guidelines carefully.

- Keys in [dictionaries](./dict) has to be in **lowercase** and alphabetically sorted.
- Avoid entries that are common English words. (e.g. `ruby`, `android` could be used in a English sentence but not necessary refer to those brand/technology)
- Since `case-police` will only fix words that have both lowercase and uppercase letters, it WON'T convert `java` to `Java`. If correct form is **a single capitalized word**, there is no need to add it to the dictionary.
- The entry should be at least 3 characters long.
- Avoid changing things other than case (e.g. NO `nodejs` -> `Node.js`)
