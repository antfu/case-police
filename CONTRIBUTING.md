## Dictionary Guidelines

Before you adding new entries to our dictionary, please read the following guidelines carefully.

- The key in [dict.json](./dict.json) has to be in lowercase and alphabetically sorted.
- Avoid entries that are common English words. (e.g. `Ruby`, `Android` could be matched in a common English sentence but not necessary refer to the brand/technology)
- Since `case-police` will only fix words that have both lowercase and uppercase letters, it WON'T convert `java` to `Java`. If correct form is a single capitalized word, there is need add it to the dictionary.
- The entry should be at least 3 characters long.
